A Replication of Alan Kruegerâ€™s "What Makes a Terrorist?"
=========================================================

This was my 2012 replication the work included in Alan Krueger's 2007 book "What Makes a Terrorist?". To follow this replication, access Krueger's original data from http://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01zg64tk97j

The paper was replicated as part of Professor Robert Pollin and Professor Michael Ash's Applied Econometrics course. This was the same class/cohort that led to the publishing of Thomas Herndon's influential 2010 paper 'Growth in a Time of Debt.'
